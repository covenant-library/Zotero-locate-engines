# Zotero Lookup Engines for Covenant Theological Seminary

The engines.json file here defines several options for looking up items from a Zotero library in differnet search engines useful for collection development at Covenant Seminary's Buswell Library. Some of these may also be useful for research and reference purposes.

To install these lookup engines, copy the engines.json file into the `locate` folder within your [Zotero data directory](https://www.zotero.org/support/zotero_data), or copy and paste individual lookup engine definitions from this file into the engines.json file that already exists there by default. (Make sure Zotero is not running when replacing or modifying the engines.json file.)
